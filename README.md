<b>Updates:</b>

#### 10-24-2020:
 The program, in its _ALPHA_ stage, has given the user full access to all 3 tabs, with only 1 button being functional: The quantity drop-down on the produce tab. Besides the visuals, the data-base is ready for implementation in the next stages of development.
  
#### 10-31-2020: 
  The program is now in its _BETA_ stage. The program is now heavily-connected to the database to send and grab info to put into the program's UI elements.
 
#### 11-27-2020: 
  The program is now it its _RELEASE_ stage. The UI now has a 4th Employee tab to allow employee users to login to log the quantitites they record for production. As said, the recording log system now saves to the database to allow for history to be maintained to view previous employee actions.
  
<b>Notes:</b>
- If the user doesn't log in, the logs will set the username as anonymous. I could have simply made the button not work if they weren't logged in- but I thought it'd be more interesting to see how often a product is logged without an employee being logged in. Of course, this would never be something utilized in a real piece of software. This was only for visual purposes.
- Having an incorrect name format set sthe username to 'default.'
- The login info gets displayed in the logs but does not save to the database since it's not a product. I wanted to show when the login is confirmed.
